The projects I work on in the CS internship program.

## 1. **Zip Extractor Project**
In Step 4, I had to write a program to extract and read the Forex data.  
[Zip Extractor from Scratch](https://github.com/nargesghan/cs_internship_journey/tree/main/zip%20extractor%20from%20scratch)

### Modules Used:
- `os`
- `zipfile`

## 2. **time series**
 In Step 5, I worked on the Forex data mentioned earlier and calculated the moving average of this data. Additionally, I practiced with the Seattle Bicycle Counts using Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas.
Modules Used:

### modules Used:
- `zipfile`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`

## 3. **pandas-numpy-matplotlib**

In step 5, I prepared three learning materials for machine learning libraries. I used their cheat sheets and documentation as sources. These notebooks contain useful methods from these libraries, along with examples and sufficient explanations.

## 4. **simple-classification**
In step 6, I implemented a simple one-layer neural network using the NumPy library. I used three different learning algorithms for this task: Perceptron, Adaline, and Adaline with stochastic gradient descent. I trained all of these algorithms using the Iris dataset. If you're interested in learning how to implement a single-layer neural network from scratch, don't miss this notebook.
